abstract = {Here, we analyze sparse analysis windows for complex-valued and real-valued discrete Gabor transforms. A number of theories presented in this study indicate that the existence and uniqueness of a sparse analysis window for a given synthesis window depend to a great extent on the sparsity of the synthesis window. Specifically, the upper and lower bounds on the analysis window sparsity are obtained for synthesis windows of different sparsities and analyzed in detail. Particularly, if the sparsity of a given synthesis window with connected support is equal to the discrete Gabor transform time-shift parameter, the sparsest analysis window is unique. In addition, we propose an algorithm that searches for a sparse analysis window. Compared with existing algorithms, a sparse analysis window with fewer nonzero elements and/or smaller reconstruction errors can be obtained with the proposed algorithm. A sequence of experimental results reveals its superior effectiveness. In addition, a better Gabor representation with high concentration and time---frequency resolution is obtained with the sparse analysis window.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of an algorithm that can be optimized for a specific acoustic environment to improve the intelligibility of whispered speech. A new convolutive non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm is proposed to extract phoneme bases from noisy whispered speech with the noise bases from prior learning; these noise bases are obtained from training using the conventional non-negative matrix factorization. The divergence function with a sparseness constraint term is selected as the objective function in the developed algorithm to obtain multiplicative update rules of the phoneme base matrix and the corresponding weight matrix. The weights of the noise bases from prior learning are also updated in the phoneme learning stage. Listening experiments were conducted to assess the intelligibility performance of speech synthesized using the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is very effective for improving the intelligibility of whispers in various noise contexts, and it outperforms conventional algorithms.},
